1. An introduction where the problem is described. For example, what
should the program do? Which classes do you have to define? Which
methods do you have to implement for these classes?
2. A description of possible alternative solutions that were discussed, and a
description of the chosen solution and the reason for choosing this solution
rather than others. It is also a good idea to mention the related theoretical
concepts of object-oriented programming that were applied as part of the
solution.
3. A conclusion that describes how well the solution worked in practice,
i.e. did the tests show that the classes were correctly implemented? You
can also mention any difficulties during the implementation as well as any
doubts you might have had.
